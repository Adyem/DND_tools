ft_hashmap: A simple and lightweight hash map implementation to manage key-value pairs efficiently.

ft_array_resize: A dynamic array resize function, similar to realloc, but with added safety and custom logic. You could integrate it with your custom allocator for optimized memory management.

ft_vector: A dynamic array implementation similar to the C++ std::vector for automatic resizing and management of elements.

ft_logger: A lightweight logger function to log messages at different levels (info, warning, error) to help with debugging.

ft_random: A random number generator that can handle a variety of cases, from simple integer ranges to floats or seeded random number generation.

ft_time: A utility for time formatting, including functions like getting the current time in different formats or measuring time deltas for performance metrics.
